# AllInOneBuffet
My project is called the "All In One Buffet." This tailors both of my interests and uses it for societal and personal impact/growth. These 2 areas include stocks and Covid-19. The four programs I developed include Covid19 Visualization, Stock Price prediction using linear regression, Stock Sentiment Analysis using news headlines, and Covid19 Twitter sentiment analysis. These 4 programs are combined together in a console-based project which is demonstrated in the video. Stocks and Covid-19 include many numbers, data, and a lot of other statistics but I wanted to create a way that will make this entire process easier. Through sentiment analysis, it provides such a simple way to interpret key trends and stigma surrounding it without having to read through all the articles and understanding all the numbers. The visualization portion helps increase the understanding of the user in terms of stock growth and Covid19 in perspective. I plan on building it through the Tweepy API, Quandl API, NLTK Vader for sentiment analysis, Pandas for data frames, Beautiful Soup to parse HTML Data, and MatplotLib for beautified visualizations to put it all in retrospect.
